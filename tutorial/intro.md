# Tutorial

Welcome to chumsky's tutorial.

Chumsky is a parser combinator library that allows you to write high-performance parser with ease without sacrificing on
error quality, flexibility, or parser recovery options.

This tutorial is split up into several sections. Each section is intended to take about **15 minutes** to complete,
although your mileage may vary. Later sections introduce more challenging concepts, so might take longer for those that
are still learning Rust concepts.
