/// A trait that describes a span over a particular range of inputs.
///
/// Spans typically consist of some context, such as the file they originated from, and a start/end offset. Spans are
/// permitted to overlap one-another. The end offset must always be greater than or equal to the start offset.
///
/// Span is automatically implemented for [`Range<T>`] and [`(C, Range<T>)`].
pub trait Span {
    /// Extra context used in a span.
    ///
    /// This is usually some way to uniquely identity the source file that a span originated in such as the file's
    /// path, URL, etc.
    ///
    /// NOTE: Span contexts have no inherent meaning to Chumsky and can be anything. For example, [`Range<usize>`]'s
    /// implementation of [`Span`] simply uses [`()`] as its context.
    type Context;

    /// A type representing a span's start or end offset from the start of the input.
    ///
    /// Typically, [`usize`] is used.
    ///
    /// NOTE: Offsets have no inherently meaning to Chumsky and are not used to decide how to prioritise errors. This
    /// means that it's perfectly fine for tokens to have non-continuous spans that bear no relation to their actual
    /// location in the input stream. This is useful for languages with an AST-level macro system that need to
    /// correctly point to symbols in the macro input when producing errors.
